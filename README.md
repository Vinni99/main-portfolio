To Install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

'cd my-app' - To change the directory to the newly created project.

'npm start' - To start the development server.

npm install gh-pages --save-dev - The command installs the gh-pages package locally within your project directory. It will be available for use in your project's scripts or commands.
After installation, you can typically configure your package.json file to include scripts that automate the deployment of your application to GitHub Pages using gh-pages. For example, you might add a script like "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"

npm run deploy - The command deploys the app to GitHub Pages.
